Product Name: Moneyball

Product Description: 
Words cannot describe how much I love playing sports. My two favourite sports are Cricket and Football. As the Fifa world cup is trending I decided to build an interactive soccer website where people can pick their own team and matches and update the stats. The idea of this product was inspired from the real time movie Brad pitt's Moneyball. Where he uses data analysis to make the team win. 

Website navigation:
After user completes the sign in process he/she can select the team he wants to add, after that he/she can select their favourite team player. Besides this, user gets another option to select the matches as well. By this the website creates an opportunity to interact with the user. The data given by the user is also stored in the database. By this the user can enter the details and update them whenever needed and review later.
